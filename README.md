## 🖊️ Basic Stuffs
- I am a Creator since 2007, most of the time I upload tools and content in the name of my friend Group (Memo2007Ultra)
- And I am also a Computer Science Graduate from South Dakota State University

<br>
<br>
<br>

## 📦 Things I make and What tools I use
I usually categorize these things into 3 Parts : Art, Games, and Education

### 🎨 Art
- 2D Drawings *(Pencil & Paper, IbisPaint)*
- 3D Modeling and Building and Shader Coding *(Blender, Unity, HLSL)*
- Music Composing *(FLStudio)*
- Music Video Animation *(Unity)*
- WebApp Artistic Tools *(HTML, CSS, Js, WebAudioAPI, GitHubPages, Wix)*

### 👾 Games
- Most of the time, simple WebApp Games *(HTML, CSS, Js)*, no accounts, no ads
- Sometimes Unity Games *(Unity, C#)*

### 🪴 Education
I usually dive into either Math or Computer Science,
And sometimes I make WebApps to visualize or make some concepts easier to understand
*(HTML, CSS, Js, MathJax, GitHubPages, Wix, C++)*
